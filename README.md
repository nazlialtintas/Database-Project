In this project, a detailed analysis was conducted to understand user needs and project requirements.
Based on this analysis, a simple system architecture was designed, and an interface layout that users could easily understand was created. 
The categories and subcategories necessary for the system's operation were structured in the most optimal way. 
Additionally, the main data tables were designed, and the relationships between these tables were thoroughly analyzed.

During the database management phase, a structure compatible with the E-R diagram was created using PostgreSQL 
and PgAdmin was utilized to interact with and manage the database files.
For the frontend development, a user interface was built using HTML and CSS, and Angular was employed to make the interface dynamic.
On the backend, Java was used alongside the Spring Boot framework to develop RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

In the final stage, all these components were integrated, and the designed E-R diagram was implemented 
using PostgreSQL for the database, Angular for the frontend, and Spring Boot for the backend.
By the end of this process, the project was successfully completed, meeting all defined requirements.
